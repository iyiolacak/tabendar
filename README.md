**Your new tab is yours, again.**  

It’s a **fully customizable, open-source** new tab experience so in other words, create a vibe that sparks joy every time you Ctrl+T

Tabendar is Different

Unlike other new tab extensions that leave you with zero control, and a search bar that you'll never use, Tabendar lets you have fun while staying productive.

- Track your GitHub streaks – Keep an eye on your code progress right from your new tab.
- Make it your personal space – Pin your favorite stickers, books, posters, and widgets.
- Track your progress – Log your book pages, and watch them appear on your heatmap.
- Zero config headache – Drag, drop, customize. Simple.
- Built for developers, artists, students, or anyone who just wants their browser to feel like home.

Tabendar isn’t just another tab extension. **It’s your space.**

##  **How Tabendar Project Started and Final Thoughts**  
One day, I installed a new Linux distro, and the default Firefox browser gave me a shiny white blank page. It’s like my new tab was an empty canvas, but I didn’t want to just look at it forever. I wanted to make it mine. After months of ignoring it, I said no more and Tabendar was born. Your new tab, your vibe, your productivity, ... whatever PRs are welcomed!

No tracking. No bloat. Just **your space, your way.**  

### Note From the Creator

Tabendar is my love letter to everyone who wants their tools to feel like home. it's about creating a digital space that makes you smile when you Ctrl+T.

Make it weird. Make it wonderful. Make it yours.

Now go stick some anime cats on your GitHub stats.
