# Tabendar  

**Your new tab is yours, again.**  

Most new tab extensions? Just pretty wallpapers. **Tabendar** is built different.  

Itâ€™s a **fully customizable, open-source** new tab experience where **youâ€™re in control**.  
- Want a **clean productivity dashboard**? Done.  
- Want to **track your GitHub streaks**? Easy.  
- Want to **stick books, posters, or random things on your new tab just for the vibe?** Hell yeah.  

### **ðŸ”¹ What Makes Tabendar Different?**  
Unlike other new tabs that give you **zero** control, **Tabendar makes customization actually easy.**  
- **See your work in action** â€“ Track your **GitHub streaks** and productivity hours.  
- **Turn your new tab into a mood** â€“ Add **stickers, posters, books, or widgets** to make it feel like your own space.  
- **Visualize your progress** â€“ Read a book? Log 10 pages, and it reflects on your **heatmap**.  
- **Zero config headache** â€“ Everything is **drag, drop, customize**(if not yet, it's meant to be and I am and welcomed contributors are working hard towards that mission!). No complicated setup.  
- **Built for devs, artists, and anyone who wants their browser to feel like home.**  

Tabendar isnâ€™t just another tab extension. **Itâ€™s your space.**

## âš¡ **Final Thoughts**  
Tabendar started as a way to **make my own browser experience better.** Now itâ€™s open-source so **everyone can use it.**  

No tracking. No bloat. Just **your space, your way.**  

If that sounds like something youâ€™d use, **give it a shot.**  

ðŸ”¥ **Make your browser your own today and feel free again.**
